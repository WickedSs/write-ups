i solved this challenge by chance ! 
i just a trick my friend show me before, i didn't know it was going to work 


my payload was --> " 127.0.0.1 ; python -m SimpleHTTPServer 54698 ", i used burp suit to do it as usual !
at first i go now respond so i thought it didn't work but when i navigated to " http://2018shell.picoctf.com:54698 " i found magic 

- flag.txt
- index.php
- index.txt
- xinet_startup.sh

i clicked " flag.txt " and i got the flag 
i mean how the fuck it did it work, this is impossible ! loooooooooooooool
