Jinja templating is the key !

1 -> click on add cards 
2 -> type {{ config }} on the question field, and something on teh answer field then press submit
3 -> click list cards 
4 -> you will find that in the question field, the app config where printed there 
5 -> look for 'secret_key' and that your flag



to be honest i never thought that we can exploit a web app using jinja templating, this was a new discovery to me !
